============
SIMULATION
============

This project supports two different simulation options.

One uses Xilinx simulation ISIM. It uses xilinx's secure IP module to
simulate cycle accurate dram transactions. The other is a verilator
sim which uses a simple home-grown dram controller and model that is
not cycle accurate. This was necessary because verilator does not
support encrypted modules as xilinx ISIM does.


To run ISIM sim, run:
 > make sim_isim
from the top level. Modify the sim/isim_tests.v file to change
your tests.

To run Verilator sim, run:
 > make sim
Then you can use the devfactory in the sim directory to run
ubitests in the py/UXN1230/ubitest suite.

COREGEN / DDR2 INTERFACE
========================

You must use Xilinx Coregen to generate the DDR2 interface. Here are
the options:

- Spartan 6, xc6slx16, Package csg324, speed grade 2
- Memory Bank 3 (C3)
- Frequency: ????
- Part: MT47H32M16HR-25E:G-ND
- Configuration: Four bi-directional ports
- Round Robin Arbitration
- Calbirated Input Termination RZQ: P4, ZIO: N4
